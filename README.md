Bank Customer Churn Prediction üè¶
Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a bank using Python. The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer churn and build a predictive model.

Dataset 
The dataset contains customer details such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, and churn status. Click Here For Dataset

Features
Credit Score: Customer's creditworthiness.
Geography: Country of the customer.
Gender: Male or Female.
